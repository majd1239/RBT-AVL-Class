# Binary-Search-Trees-Class-AVL-Red-Black-

This is a binary search tree class that features AVL and Red & Black trees. They are children of a BST class that result in a lot of code reuse.

The class was created using boolean abstraction as the node children. The children is a size two array of node pointers where index 1 (True) is the right child and index 0 (False) is the left child.

This was used to avoid code repetition due to the symmetric nature of binary trees.
